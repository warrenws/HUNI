<p>Good morning #RECIPIENT#,</p>

<p>This is an automated email from the Inventory Site letting you know you should change your password before the end of school.  Even if you recently changed your password you should change it again to ensure your password doesn't expire over the summer. </p>
   
<p>If you're using an Apple then follow the instructions in the video to reset your password.  If you're using a PC hit Ctrl + Alt + Delete and click the change password button.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
