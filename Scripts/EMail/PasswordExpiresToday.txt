<p>Good morning #RECIPIENT#,</p>

<p>This is an automated email from the Inventory Site letting you know your password will expire today at #PASSWORDRESETTIME#.</p>
   
<p>You can reset your password before it expires.  Doing so should prevent any keychain problems on an Apple.  If you're using an Apple then follow the instructions in the video to reset your password.  If you're using a PC hit Ctrl + Alt + Delete and click the change password button.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Please do not respond to this message...</p>
